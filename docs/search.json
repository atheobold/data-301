This will grant you a 72-hour (3-day) extension.\nThe rules for these are as follows:\n\nYou must request the extension through the Google form linked on Canvas. Any other request (e.g., by email, Discord message, verbally, etc.) does not count unless the Google form is filled out.\nThe extension must be requested before the deadline has passed (i.e., before Friday at 11:59pm).

You don’t have to tell why you need the extension - maybe you have a busy week with other work, maybe you are traveling with a sports team, maybe you partied too hard for your friend’s birthday.

In general, if something comes up in your life, I always want to find a way to help. Please let me know what your situation is, and we’ll work together to find a good solution.\nThe most important thing is that you tell me early. As a rule, I do not grant extensions after the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOf course, in the case of a major crisis, that is truly exceptional and unforeseen, all these rules go out the window.

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nYou are expected to abide by the Cal Poly Code of Conduct at all times.\n\nPlagiarism\nYou are encouraged to work with other classmates on all but the exam portions of this class. You are also encouraged (realistically, required!) to make use of online resources to accomplish tasks.\nWhen dealing with code, follow these guidelines:\n\nNever copy-paste more than small snippets of code. That is, you might borrow a little three-line function from StackOverflow, but you should not copy over a full analysis you find on Kaggle.\nAttribute all code that is not completely your own. If you do borrow that StackOverflow snippet, provide a link to the source. If you reference a similar analysis for ideas, mention that in your description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nA good “rule of thumb” is: If I sat you down by yourself in a room with no internet, could you explain to me roughly what each line of code is doing? If not, you are probably borrowing more than you should from your online source.\n(In fact, this is exactly what I will do if I need to investigate possible cheating.)\n\n\n\nAI tools\nNew AI models like Chat GPT offer a whole new world of online coding resources. This is exciting! You should absolutely feel free to get help from these tools, they are excellent at answering questions.\nHowever, from an academic integrity perspective, treat these AI generative chat resources like, say, a tutor. Asking a tutor to help explain a homework concept to you or help debug your code? Totally fine! Giving the tutor a homework question and having them answer the whole thing? Nope. Talking to a tutor at all, about anything, during the course of the exam? Unacceptable.\n\n\n\nIntegrity Violations\nIf you accidentally forget a small citation, or go a little overboard in how much you “borrow” from StackOverflow, you’ll get a warning and a grade deduction on that assignment.\nAny instance of willful and deliberate cheating will result in a failing grade on the assignment and I will file a academic integrity report with the Office of Student Rights and responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBe careful about being on the giving end as well as the taking end. For example: If you send your finished assignment to a friend, and that friend copies it, you have both received a failing grade on the assignment and a report filed to OSRR.\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual property\nThe materials for this course are legally the professor’s intellectual property.\nMost class materials are publicly shared, and you are welcome to direct others to this resource at any time. You are also welcome to publicly share any or all of your work on the class project.\nNon-public class materials—most importantly, assignment solutions and any exam materials—may never be shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is not just an issue of academic honestly, it is quite literally a legal copyright scenario. Please do not distribute solutions or exam questions from this class anywhere, for any reason. Doing so is a violation of the Code of Conduct, and it may constitute a violation of U.S. copyright law.",

    "text": "Takeaways\n\n\n\nWe use plotnine and the grammar of graphics to make visuals.\nFor two categorical variables, we might use a stacked bar plot, a side-by-side bar plot, or a stacked percentage bar plot - depending on what we are trying to show.\nThe joint distribution of two variables gives the percents in each subcategory.\nThe marginal distribution of a variable is its individual distribution.\nThe conditional distribution of a variable is its distribution among only one category of a different variable.\nWe calculate the conditional distribution by dividing the joint by the marginal.",
