# Overview

Your final project is your chance to demonstrate your knowledge from DATA 301 in a real-world setting. You will choose a dataset, or possibly multiple
related datasets, and perform an analysis to address your group's research
question(s).

You will summarize your findings into a poster, and present it during the
common hour final poster session (with both sections of DATA 301) on
**Saturday, March 15th**. Dr. Theobold will post the time of the final once
Cal Poly has let them know, but it will either be from 1:10pm to 3pm or from
4:10 to 6pm. 

Projects may be done in groups of **up to 3 students**. The guidelines are
the same regardless; that is, if you choose to work alone, I will expect the
same level of quality as if you choose to work in a group of 3.

No extensions will be granted for projects, except in highly unusual,
extenuating circumstances. Please start early!

# Checkpoint 1: Project Proposal

To make sure you are on track, you have a two-page project proposal due on
Friday, February 21.

This proposal must be two pages only, and it must contain:

1. Your group member names.

2. Information about the dataset(s) you intend to analyze:

    + Where are the data located?
    + Who collected the data and why?
    + What information (variables) are in the dataset?

3. Research Questions: You should have one primary research question and a few secondary questions

4. Preliminary exploration of your dataset(s): A few simple plots or summary
statistics that relate to the variables you plan to study.

# Finding Data

Some good places to find datasets are:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

- [Google Data Set Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

- [Reddit Datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/?rdt=50958)

- [List of JSON APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

- [Project Gutenberg (good source of textual data)](https://www.gutenberg.org/)

- State or federal government websites, such as the [U.S. Governmentâ€™s Open Data](https://data.gov/)

# Printing Your Final Poster

[This website](https://slidesgo.com/research-poster?format=4%3A3) has some
poster templates that you can (but are not required to) use. Your poster will
need to be printed on 24" x 36" paper. You may select all the most basic
printing options (e.g., matte paper, no lamination, not mounted). I would 
recommend printing you poster at Staples since they have a quick turnaround and
basic posters cost about $30. 

If you need assistance with the cost of printing a poster, please let Dr. 
Theobold know. 

# Final Poster Grading

Your posters will be graded on:

- Presentation:
    
    + Was the poster clear and visually appealing?
    + Do the visualizations tell a story?
    + Were the presenters able to describe the project and answer questions?

- Correctness:
    
    + Were the correct summaries and analyses chosen for the data?
    + Were the results correctly interpreted and described?
    + Was the choice of analysis reasonable for the research question?

- Complexity:

    + Did the project address multiple rich aspects of the dataset(s)?
    + Did the project use skills from across the quarter to answer questions?
    + Did the project incorporate something from Week 9 or 10? (Webscraping, 
    APIs, data joining) or from beyond the course?

- Data insight:
    
    + Were the research questions interesting and insightful?
    + Did the project make clear and relevant data conclusions?
    + Does the project tell a story with real-world impact?
