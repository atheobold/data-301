## Discussion Questions 

1. What is the significance of the title Weapons of Math Destruction?

2. According to O’Neil, is every mathematical model a Weapon of Math
Destruction? Why or why not?

3. O'Neil characterizes some algorithms as “Weapons of Math Destruction.” Who is
most vulnerable to being harmed by their use?

4. Have you had experiences with algorithms that O’Neil’s account illuminates?

The proliferation of WMDs seems to stem from our innate attraction to numeric
rankings. Often, an “anti” WMD would require significant investment of time,
money, and human capital to evaluate whatever metric (teacher performance,
expected criminal recidivism, credit history etc.) is currently being assessed
by a WMD. 

<!-- What would it take for an education algorithm to meet all of O’Neil’s criteria for not doing damage? -->

5. Is there a scale on which we believe we can replace the efficiency of
WMDs with the more expensive alternative? Are algorithms our only answer to
tackling big data?

6. Should there be a Bill of Rights around data? What would it entail and who
would it be for?

7. What is (or what could be) the role of data scientists in data justice?
