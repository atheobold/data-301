For the first part of this week, we are going to 
interrogate the idea of data "neutrality." Specifically, we are going to learn about the
the multiple layers of context that are important to consider when working with any set of data. 

[The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3)

> Data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis.

## Discussion Questions

<!-- What problems does big data solve versus create? -->

<!-- What are your thoughts on how we label graphs with context? -->

<!-- Where does responsibility lie for proving data context in your area? How does funding play in? -->

<!-- Which actors in the data ecosystem are responsible for providing context? End  users? Data publishers? Data intermediaries?   -->

<!-- What steps can we take to ensure context is considered? How can we more effectively present context through data visualization? -->

<!-- Which power imbalances have led to silences in the dataset or data that is missing altogether?  -->

<!-- Library of missing data: -->
