## Missing Lab

-   **Best option:** Go to another section. 

-   **Second-best option:** Turn in your work by email to me.

-   **Worst option:** Miss it entirely, get a 0.

-   *You may do each of these options only twice. If you need to miss / reschedule more than 3 of the sections in the quarter, you will need to retake the class.*

## Discord and Email

-   Class questions go on **DISCORD**

-   Use my email **only** for personal concerns that you want to talk about
privately to me.

# Setup

## Colab Notebooks

-   In Data Science, everyone uses **Notebooks**, not scripts, for coding.

-   We will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** (invented at Cal Poly!), hosted for
free by **Google Colab**.

-   If you want to work offline, you can install **Anaconda** on your laptop.

-   I recommend an IDE like **PyCharm** as well.

# The Brave New World of GenAI

## Academic Integrity

-   If you copy text from a website into your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you ask your friend to write your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you pay someone else to write your essay, it's cheating.

....

-   If you ask GenAI to do your work and then copy the answers, it's cheating.

## Conversation, not copying

It is okay (in fact, encouraged) to ...

-   Ask GenAI for tips on how to get started on a coding problem

-   Ask GenAI to help find bugs in your code

-   Ask GenAI to help explain concepts or functions

-   **Pretend ChatGPT is your human tutor or TA!**
