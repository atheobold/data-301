# The Brave New World of GenAI

## Academic Integrity

-   If you copy text from a website into your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you ask your friend to write your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you pay someone else to write your essay, it's cheating.

-   If you ask GenAI to do your work and then copy the answers, it's cheating.

## Conversation, not copying

It is okay (in fact, encouraged) to ...

-   Ask GenAI for tips on how to get started on a coding problem

-   Ask GenAI to help find bugs in your code

-   Ask GenAI to help explain concepts or functions

-   **Pretend ChatGPT is a tutor or a TA!**
