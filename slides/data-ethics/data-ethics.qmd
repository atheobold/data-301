The American Statistical Association’s Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice are intended to help statistics practitioners make decisions ethically. Additionally, the ethical guidelines aim to promote accountability by informing those who rely on statistical analysis of the standards they should expect.

## Technical Responsibilities

::: {.midi}
Ensuring analyses are valid.
:::

. . .

- Checking assumptions (e.g. no t-tests when sample size is small)
- Matching analyses to data types (e.g., no linear regression with 0/1 response)

## Reproducibility and documentation

:::{.midi}
Being transparent about your process and its limitations.
:::

. . .

- Reporting insignificant results, not just significant ones
- Reproducibility and documentation of data processing
- Being clear about the scope of the conclusions
- Sharing your work openly when possible

## Professional responsibilities

::: {.midi}
Performing analyses and communicating results in ways that are not misleading, even when you could get away with it.
:::

. . .

- No p-hacking / gathering extra data until it’s significant
- No switching your hypotheses after seeing the data (or running the analysis)
- No dropping NAs unless you can justify that they are a random subset

*"Data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis."*

## Data Science Oath

::: {.smaller}

> I will respect the privacy of my data subjects, for their data are not disclosed to me that the world may know, so I will tread with care in matters of privacy and security.

> I will remember that my data are not just numbers without meaning or context, but represent real people and situations, and that my work may lead to unintended societal consequences, such as inequality, poverty, and disparities due to algorithmic bias.

## Social Responsibilities

::: {.midi}
Considering impact, harm, and power.
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Checking that the data collection process is not harmful (e.g. unethical experiments, uncomfortable survey questions, omitting certain groups from the study)
- Checking that the data cleaning process is not harmful (e.g. “othering” groups)
- Considering how conclusions will be used (e.g. who funded the study, what might they use it for, etc. - like crime prediction tools and such)

# Option 1 -- Midterm Revisions

:::{.smaller}
- Dig deeper into *who* the data were collected on. 
  * What was the context of the data collection? 
  * Who was included in the sample? 
  * How does this impact the inferences that can be made from these data?
  
- Think about how your model could impact *people*. 
  * Who could your model detrimentally impact?
  * In what way would these individual be impacted?

# Option 2 -- Final Project

::: {.smaller}
- Outline a "Limitations" section
  * What context were the data collected from? How does that limit what can be inferred from your model?
  * How could your model detrimentally impact people? How will you ensure this will not happen?
